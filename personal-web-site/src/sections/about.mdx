## About

I am an Electronic Engineer with a specialization in Engineering Project Management and a FullStack developer with experience in single-page applications development using responsive design.
Iâ€™ve been part of a team who developed an Airbnb clone. This allowed me to get involved in a professional environment, using programming languages, platforms and libraries such as React, Redux, and Node Js. The deployment of this project allowed me to strengthen my practice in HTML, CSS and SASS. The team handled the entire project with the version control system Git-Github. 

I have 10 years of experience in telecommunication projects. This experience has given me the ability to lead projects, communicate with confidence, and allowed me to acquire a strong ability to analyze and solve problems. I have worked as a project manager for clients in the public and private sector, this role has required me to demonstrate efficiency in planning, forecasting, setting objectives, and determining courses of action. It was highly rewarding to achieve the expected results.
